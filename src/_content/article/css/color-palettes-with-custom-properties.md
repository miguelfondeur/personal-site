title: Color Palettes with Custom Properties
summary:
  CSS Custom Properties make theming simpler than ever, yet very few developers use them.
  We would rather rely on CSS frameworks and libraries. I understand the convenience factor, but
  we should at least know what's possible. In the event you want to use limited tooling and only use
  what you need. In this example, I'll create a Tailwind style color paletter with CSS and create some color varients along with it.
