## A Long Time Ago in 2021

Developers were still (mostly) writing code manually. Looking up answers on Google, or Stack Overflow (RIP). If you wanted to learn something new, you would go to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), still a great resource. And all of us developers never admitted when we didn't know something‚Äîwe just pretended to be experts, while all carrying our own degree of imposter syndrome. Those were the good old days.

More and more, ChatGPT started to creep into our lives. We kept hearing news of its improvements. Then we tried it. Was it always correct? No. Was it fast? Yes. Did we think it would get better? Not exactly. So we all went about our business, trying to shrug it off as *glorified auto-correct*. But it left a little imprint.

## As Time Went On

Slowly, it started to nag at us.  
"This thing makes bugs."  
"It's bad for the environment."  
"It writes too much code."  
"We'll all be dumber for using it."  
"It's plagiarism."

But those thoughts didn't make LLMs go away. They were getting more capable. Companies were developing new models. AI safety was a hot topic. And it kept going. *Spaghetti Will Smith*. *The Hess Truck Commercial*. *The ability to mimic voices accurately*. *Better and better code*... The wheels kept going. Felt like we were willingly feeding the beast. Humans, am I right?

## How I Felt About It

I started using ChatGPT regularly in 2023. It was good, but not great. I thought, *"Hell, if it can help me finish projects I haven‚Äôt had time for, why not?"* It struggled with creative coding. Still not there. But it was good for stupid tasks‚Äîalphabetize JSON lists, convert functions from one language to another. Then I realized my favorite way of using it was as a kind of *Rubber Duck*. I would give it my opinions and basically see if I was on the right track or not. A little better than talking to a physical rubber duck.

But I still felt that *real* developers needed to code everything themselves. I cared about my craft so much, I didn‚Äôt even use Copilot. I thought the human element of writing code is what would differentiate us from the LLM. The better my code, the more success was guaranteed. Many of us carry this kind of naive optimism that might actually be closer to a form of arrogance and pride.

And I've always subscribed to the Field of Dreams method of product development: *"If you build it, they (the customers) will come."*

## Fast Forward to 2025

By the beginning of this year, Vibe Coding platforms like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh), Bolt, Lovable, and Windsurf were popping up everywhere. I didn't give it any thought because I was still very much a purist. Truth be told, after 12 years in this industry, I was tired of the new trends, constant measuring contests, volatility‚Äîand I was thinking of leaving the professional coding space for good. Still building the occasional passion project. I'm a tinkerer.

But I decided to look for new job opportunities and called my friend Bogdan. He said, *"If you're going to go back to the workforce, I strongly suggest you learn Cursor."* Bogdan is a senior dev with 10+ years of professional experience like me... and he suggested I... cheated??

So I tried it. It was good. But like GPT, it wasn‚Äôt great with complex, creative projects. I was seeing its limitations. But... I was also seeing its strengths. Understanding the context of your code, reading files... spooky stuff! I ended up using it a bit on my blog site. It helped me clean up my vanilla CSS. I reviewed the code‚Äîand it was pretty good. 

But I still wasn‚Äôt really convinced.

## The Light Bulb Moment

Bogdan built a joke application called [LayoffBot](https://layoffbot.ai/) after a conversation we had about how inhumane tech companies were when laying off the people that built their businesses. It went viral. I took a peek and said, *"Damn dude, nice design."* He said, *"Oh I did that in Bolt."*

So I tried [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new). I gave it a prompt to build an application that I was working on for my kids.

**Man....**

Have you ever been so impressed and freaked out that you literally laugh out loud? That was my reaction. This thing could code, and design, and give you a preview in the browser‚Äîwithout you paying a dime. That‚Äôs when I realized...

## We're Cooked

Not because it could code better than a developer. Not because it was more creative than a designer. Not because it was secure, performant, accessible, or could read your mind.

All of those things were still **NOT** the case.

But I realized... *it's good enough*.

As an American, I recognize that our society doesn‚Äôt necessarily praise meticulous artistry as much as it settles for what‚Äôs convenient. I spent years of my life trying to build the next best thing. Arrogantly thinking that I knew what that thing was, and having it fall on deaf ears. *"Why didn‚Äôt it go viral? My code... my precious code..."*

No one cares.

The only thing most people care about is the finished product. And when they interact with said product, you have a very limited time to make sure that it is engaging and simple enough for them to invest in it. You don't decide‚Äîthe market decides.

Likewise, if you're selling your software services to a company and they think an LLM coding platform is more convenient (whether it's true or not), they're probably NOT going to purchase your "services". Don't take it personal. 

One thing is for sure, we're not in Kansas anymore. 

## A Little Optimism

As I started to accept these new technologies, I thought, *"Fuck it, I‚Äôm going to build my app with it."*

Took me 4 days from start to finish to create the project, export to Cursor, integrate Supabase, and deploy. Perfect? No. Good enough to test and gather feedback? **Hell yes.**

Shortly after, Bogdan started launching more apps. We partnered together to start reviewing some vibe coded apps under the name *[V-Combinator](https://v-combinator.com)*. And we got more and more interested in this space.

## The Small Flame of Rebellion Is Sparked

We started seeing apps and websites that had *no business existing*. Things that no one in their right mind would hire a designer and a developer to build and deploy. Regular people with no experience were trying to build things *just because*. 

I've seen dating apps for dwarves, VR goggles for cows, retro snake games, and so many broken and unfinished projects.

While many high-brow developers looked at this and said, *"You see! They don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing! No one will ever replace me!"*, I thought, *"This is genius."*

The lack of polish. The lack of *Give me your email so I can give you something in return*. The lack of bullshit that has made the web boring, predictable, and monopolized to a few large companies. I was seeing a rise of what Bogdan and I call "alternative tech", and it was refreshing.

I saw personality. I saw freedom. 

At one point I would have said cynically, *"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"*.  
Now I thought... *maybe.*

## Fanning the Flame

The web is unrecognizable compared to its early years, even up through the MySpace era. Back then, it was chaotic, but you could still stumble into little corners of community. It felt more human. Less corporate.

Now, we‚Äôre all funneled into a handful of massive platforms where you are the product. They harvest your data, monetize your attention, and call it ‚Äúconnection.‚Äù You're left feeling empty and used. If you try to speak your mind, you're either banned outright or quietly buried by the algorithm.

I think we‚Äôve had enough.

**Let‚Äôs break shit again.**

I've started a project called [CHAOS BYTE](https://chaos-byte.io) to do just that. I have no idea where it will go or how we'll get there‚Äîbut I don't care too much. I care more about helping creatives and using the current tools to speak truth to power in a world that is becoming more and more about centralized control than it is about freedom of thought and expression.

So far we‚Äôll be posting fun and thought-provoking content that we've created. But we're looking for contributors.

If you'd like to get involved, go to:

Whoever you are, make something that amplifies your voice.

**Before the Technocracy takes it away.**
