title: Draw The Owl
summary: The Owl, other than being my site's mascot, has had a pretty significant meaning in my life. During my time at the Startup Institute of New York, we were given the exercise to "Draw an Owl." What seemed like a random exercise had a profound meaning that stayed with me. Let's talk about it.

<h2>Brief Background</h2>
<p>
    Before getting into the tech industry, I was a struggling musician. I worked at a music store while trying to find gigs that would pay me enough to buy more gear. I played live and did some recording. Looking back, a part of me feels like I didn't "make it" because I didn't commit hard enough. I was always the type to measure three times and think about cutting once—in other words, I was timid.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, after seeing musicians struggle (like myself) to find gigs, I thought it would be cool if there were an online platform to help musicians book shows. I felt so convicted about this idea that I quit my job, sold my gear, and started learning web development. Eventually, I built an MVP, which took me to New York to network, where I found the Startup Institute. 
</p>
<p>
    The Startup Institute was an eight-week career accelerator originally founded in Boston, designed to train people on how to land jobs at startups and connect them with potential employers.
</p>

<h2>The Exercise</h2>
<p>
    The Startup Institute separated the cohort into different disciplines: Product Design, Marketing, Software, and (I believe) Business Development. I was in the Product Design track. Each of these tracks offered courses taught by working professionals in the industry. But every once in a while, there was a group exercise.
</p>
<p>
    One of those exercises was "Draw The Owl." If I remember correctly, this was the first exercise we did as a group. One of the organizers placed a whiteboard in front of us and said, "Who wants to come up?" For some reason, I either volunteered or was voluntold.
</p>
<p>
    They gave me a simple request: "Draw an Owl." I've always been decent at drawing, but for some reason, I couldn't remember what an owl looked like. A million thoughts ran through my head: "What does this have to do with startups?" "If I fail, will this ruin my reputation?" I was overthinking it.
</p>
<p>
    But I took a breath and started drawing the owl's head in front of a room full of strangers. I heard people murmur, "Do owls have ears?" "Oh, no, those are feathers on their heads..." Eventually, I finished something that resembled an owl. Much to my surprise, the organizer was impressed—apparently, it was better than many of the owls she'd seen before. But what was the point?
</p>

<h2>The Purpose</h2>
<p>
    She then explained the purpose of the exercise. My overthinking was exactly the lesson.
</p>
<p>
    No matter how good you are at drawing, no matter what people might think of you for failing, and no matter whether you even remember what an owl looks like when the pressure is on—you have to commit. 
</p>
<p>
    If you search for "Draw the Owl," you'll likely find an image showing a two-step process: Step One, draw the head. Step Two, draw the f@#$ing owl. It's a bit aggressive, but it serves the point. It's essentially Nike's "Just Do It," but I like this version better. With Nike, you generally have an idea of what you're doing. When presented with something abstract like "Draw an Owl," there's no training—you just have to suck it up and commit, even if you fail.
</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>
    This lesson has stuck with me throughout my career and personal life. Since then, I've been thrown into complex situations more times than I can count. You don't always have time to look things up. You don't always know how your efforts will turn out. You don't always know how you'll be perceived if you succeed or fail.
</p>
<p>
    But you do have to say yes. Commit. Follow through. Finish what you started.
</p>
<p>
    Good or bad. Prepared or not.
</p>
<p>
    Draw the owl.
