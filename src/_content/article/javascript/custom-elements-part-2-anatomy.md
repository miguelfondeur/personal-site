title: "Custom Elements Part 2: Anatomy"
summary: In part one on this topic, I defined what a Custom Element is. In part 2 we'll go deeper to discuss the structure of a custom element, and the parallels to many of your modern frameworks. I'll discuss how to use properties, listen for change events, how to add logic to your templates, and much more.
