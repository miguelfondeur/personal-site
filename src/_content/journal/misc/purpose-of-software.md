<!-- 
    Primer:
    It's easy to forget what software's original purpose was or what's is purpose is 
    at all in our modern, tech driven society. After over ten years of throwing things 
    at a wall to see what sticks, you start to ask yourself questions like, how did we 
    get here, and is all of this technology we're creating actually making a difference?
    First, we need to remember the age-old anictode, there's nothing new under the sun. 
    Much of what of what we're trying to build in software is mimicing something in the 
    real world. I've compiled a list of what I believe the purpose of software is, 
    1. Simulation
        a. Written Communication
        b. Physical Activities
        c. Verbal Communication
        d. Physical Libraries
        e. Social Interaction
    2. Automation
        a. Mathmatical Formulas
        b. Workflows
    3. Connection
        a. Connects people through networks across great distances
    These things are closely related and you're going to see some overlap with these, but 
    lets dive a little deeper.
