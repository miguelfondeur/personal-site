        <p>
            As the team's frontend UI engineer I was responsible for translating our lead designers Zeplin specs to the web. I built every feature of the site using CSS3, JQuery and Django Templates. The site called for a large variety of colors, animations and fixed elements. I used GPU-friendly CSS to avoid repainting issues in the browser which greatly affect the mobile user experience. I've included a video of our mobile experience that highlights the best features of Knozen.

            I built a Tailwind utility class library called <strong>Stylesora</strong> to centralize Musora's custom styles. 
            Working closely with the UX team, I ensured all <a href="https://www.figma.com/" title="Go to Figma's website" target="_blank">Figma</a> designs were accurately reflected in the front-end implementation. By using CSS as JSON, I seamlessly integrated Stylesora into our Tailwind config, making it easy to maintain and scale our design system.
