description: Website templates built with the JAM Stack to simplify development and content management.
summary: |
  "Sites Made Simple". The goal of BLOCK Digital was to create modern, performant and light weight websites using JAM Stack technologies.
  I enging behind BLOCK was the Hugo Static Site Generator. I created reusable components or "blocks" using Hugo that could be referenced in Markdown files. These Markdown files would build out the page at run time through Netilfy. BLOCK's sites were also fully editable through Netlify's CMS which I configured using React.js. Lastly, each site came bundled with a "Style Guide" which acted as a UI reference for the client when editing their site through the CMS. It included code examples for developers as well.
accomplishments:
  [
    Built Custom CMS using Netlify CMS.,
    Created Live Preview windows using React Components.,

            I built a Tailwind utility class library called <strong>Stylesora</strong> to centralize Musora's custom styles. 
            Working closely with the UX team, I ensured all <a href="https://www.figma.com/" title="Go to Figma's website" target="_blank">Figma</a> designs were accurately reflected in the front-end implementation. By using CSS as JSON, I seamlessly integrated Stylesora into our Tailwind config, making it easy to maintain and scale our design system.
