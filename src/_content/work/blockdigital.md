description: Website templates built with the JAM Stack to simplify development and content management.
summary: |
  "Sites Made Simple." BLOCK Digital was built to deliver modern, high-performance, and lightweight websites using JAMstack technologies. At its core, BLOCK leveraged the Hugo Static Site Generator, where I developed reusable components—or “blocks”—that could be referenced in Markdown files to generate pages dynamically. The sites were deployed via Netlify, with a fully editable CMS powered by Netlify CMS and React.js.<br>
  Each site also included a custom Style Guide, serving as both a UI reference for clients and a developer-friendly resource with code examples, ensuring seamless content management and scalability.
accomplishments:
  [
    Built Custom CMS using Netlify CMS.,
    Created Live Preview windows using React Components.,
    Deployed directly to Netlify from Github Repositories.,
    Created 6 Unique website templates for various organization types.,
    Built all websites including the business site using Hugo.,
    Used Gulp for asset optimization,
    minification.,
    Connected third party API's depending on business needs.,

    <summary>Choosing the JAMstack</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p>
            The <strong>JAMstack</strong> (JavaScript, APIs, and Markdown) is a modern web architecture commonly used with <strong>static site generators</strong> like <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Go To Hugo Website" target="_blank">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" title="Go To 11ty Website" target="_blank">11ty</a>. These tools convert Markdown files into HTML at build time, eliminating the need for a server-side language like <abbr title="Personal Home Page Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>. This approach allows for reusable templates and a highly efficient deployment process.
        </p>
        <p>
            To deploy these sites, I simply pushed each project to a dedicated <strong>GitHub repository</strong> and connected it to <strong>Netlify</strong>. With minimal setup, any updates pushed to GitHub would trigger an automatic build and deployment. Netlify also provided a <strong>Git-based CMS</strong>, originally called <strong>Netlify CMS</strong> (now <a href="https://decapcms.org/docs/intro/" target="_blank" title="Go to Decap CMS website">Decap CMS</a>). Unlike traditional databases, Decap CMS stores content directly in a Git repository, making it a lightweight solution perfect for small business marketing sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enhance the CMS experience, I built <strong>custom React components</strong> for the preview window, ensuring a 1:1 representation of the final website. This approach eliminated the need for paid hosting, as there was no PHP backend to maintain. Any additional functionality—such as social media feeds or event calendars—was handled through <strong>third-party APIs</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose <strong>Hugo</strong> as the static site generator due to its <strong>blazing-fast build times</strong>. I also created multiple <strong>pre-built templates</strong> tailored to different business needs. The end result was 
            a highly adaptable system that provided small businesses with cost-effective, low-maintenance websites requiring 
            minimal configuration.

        <p>
            I built a Tailwind utility class library called <strong>Stylesora</strong> to centralize Musora's custom styles. 
            Working closely with the UX team, I ensured all <a href="https://www.figma.com/" title="Go to Figma's website" target="_blank">Figma</a> designs were accurately reflected in the front-end implementation. By using CSS as JSON, I seamlessly integrated Stylesora into our Tailwind config, making it easy to maintain and scale our design system.
