         <h1>I’m Miguel Fondeur. I've been building digital products for over ten years.</h1>
         <p>
             I specialize in reusable web components and design language systems, with experience building responsive 
             web apps across multiple devices. I focus on writing scalable, maintainable, and performant front-end code, 
             preferring clean, well-documented native JavaScript that works across all browsers.
         </p>
         <p>
             My background is in music. After earning a degree in Music Business, I spent years playing drums for various 
             artists while working at a music store. In 2013, I set out to help musicians market themselves by developing 
             an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> for my app, "nuroute." Over six months, I self-taught 
             <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.</strong>  
         </p>
         <p>
             I moved to New York to network and refine my idea but realized I needed more startup experience. That led me to 
             <strong>Startup Institute</strong>, an immersive program during New York’s "Silicon Alley" boom. The experience 
             launched me into my career in tech.
         </p>
         <p>
             Although my original idea never launched, it jumpstarted my career. Since then, I’ve worked with companies of 
             all sizes across various sectors. It’s been a wild ride, and I’m grateful for every step.

      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <p>
         This site was a labor of love. It took a long time to update my personal site because, well, life gets in the way.  
         I wanted a space to share my thoughts, so I added a blog. For the design, I kept it minimal and took inspiration from  
         <a href="https://spotlight.tailwindui.com/" title="Go to Tailwind Template">this template</a>.  
       </p>
       <p>
         The logo is my father's signature "F." He passed in 2023, and this is a small way of keeping his memory alive.  
       </p>
       <p>
         The site was built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" title="Go To 11ty's website">11ty</a>  
         static site generator and deployed to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" title="Go to Netlify's website">Netlify</a>.  
         No other build tools, no libraries, no frameworks—just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript to enhance the UX.
