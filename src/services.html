         I have over a decade of experience in designing and developing user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional. My approach combines creativity with a deep understanding of user needs, ensuring that every project I undertake delivers real value.

   <h2>Tooling</h2>
   <p>
      I prioritize writing clean, semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Starting with core web technologies ensures performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability, while giving me full control over the final product. Native JS components also work reliably across environments.
   </p>
   <p>
      At the same time, I leverage modern tools and frameworks where they add value—streamlining workflow, improving collaboration, and enhancing the overall quality of the work.
